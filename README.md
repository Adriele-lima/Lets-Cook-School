- I confirm that the navigation, header, courses page and sign up page are all readable and easy to understand.

- I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field, only numbers on the phone field and the submit button works.

## Bugs

- __Solved Bugs__

    - When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages I discovered that images were not loading and I looked into Slack and I found an student's question related to the same problem and I found what I did wrong. Basically I didn't add the relative path on the background-image "../images/photo.jpn". After I update the code, my page loaded all the pictures.

- __Unfixed Bugs__

No unfixed bugs.
